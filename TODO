Now:
- Show the current size of the ringbuffer and the speed in sensor control form
- Mutex / Semaphore for ringbuffer access

Important:
- Measure the latency (worst-, best- and average case) and reset it after resetting 
  the speed
- Makefile with Debug and Release Target, to get faster access without profiling

Maybe:
- Make the datarecorder state serializable (also load the last state on startup)

Maybe in the Future:
- Record more than one GPIO-Pin (multiple sensors)
- Save a whole recording session in a file
